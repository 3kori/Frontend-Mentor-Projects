## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

I will continue polishing on css layout, and value & units concepts.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is an reference point which helped me finally understand flexbox and positioning. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [FlexboxFroggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) - This is a fun interactive game which helped me finally understand flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
